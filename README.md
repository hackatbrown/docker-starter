# Docker Starter Kit!

Welcome to Hack@Brown's Docker starter kit! We'll go over how to create a simple container for your application, install the necessary dependencies, and deploy your container!

We're aiming to make this starter kit as simple as possible to help you quickly get a container up and running. So if you ever want to learn more or are curious about more details regarding something we cover in this kit, please reference the official Docker documentation!

Tutorial information adapted from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c-iBn73dDE).

## Getting started

Please head [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install Docker.

## What is Docker?

Docker is a service that lets you create **containers** for your applications.

Containers offer you:
- an isolated environment
- all needed configurations packaged
- commands to install and run the app

This means that you don't have to install any dependencies on your own operating system, you can install them directly to your container, and have them installed independently of whatever is on your own computer.

One major benefit of containers is that they remove the difficulties with managing and installing
dependencies all on your own, which may lead to incorrectly configured environments.
Docker gives you a way to automate and manage dependencies, along with even more benefits, which you can learn about [here](google.com)!

## How to use our starter kit

In our starter kit, we have separated out each topic in order into its own Markdown file. We have provided you with the necessary files/stencils in this repository as well.
