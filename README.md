# Docker Starter Kit!

Welcome to Hack@Brown's Docker starter kit! We'll go over how to create a simple container for your application, install the necessary dependencies, and deploy your container!

We're aiming to make this starter kit as simple as possible to help you quickly get a container up and running. So if you ever want to learn more or are curious about more details regarding something we cover in this kit, please reference the official Docker documentation!
